### Grade Breakdown

**Class Participation (25%):**
The participation component of the course grade will be made up of in-class participation, as well as effort on in-class
exercises.

**Labs (50%):**
There will be 8 labs that will be completed throughout the course and will be graded on accuracy. These
assignments are designed to have students independently implement skills learned through course material and in-class
exercises.

**Project Tasks (10%):**
Project tasks will allow students to iteratively develop their final projects throughout the course of the semester. Each
task will allow students to complete a portion of their final project and allow the instructor to give feedback throughout
the semester.

**Final Project (10%):**
The final project will be a polished version of the completed project tasks that also implement any instructor feedback
given on individual project tasks.

**Final Presentation (5%):**
Students will give a 6â€“8-minute presentation on their final project during the course exam period.
