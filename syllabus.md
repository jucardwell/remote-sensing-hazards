# GEOGXXX: Remote Sensing of Natural Hazards

Abbreviated Syllabus [Download full syllabus here]()


### Course Description
This course introduces students to the capabilities of analyzing remotely-sensed and other spatial gridded data products through Google Earth Engine (GEE). With a focus on utilizing these data products to monitor the impacts of natural hazards, the course combines comprehensive remote sensing topics—including theory, data acquisition, and data analysis—with a deep understanding of natural hazards, their potential to become disasters, and the remote sensing products available for monitoring these events and their environmental impacts.

Students will execute analyses in Google Earth Engine, primarily using GEE's JavaScript API. The curriculum emphasizes practical applications and hands-on learning, culminating in an independent research project. In this project, students will utilize GEE datasets related to natural hazards to conduct their own analyses on a hazard of interest, integrating the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course.

### Course Goals and Learning Outcomes
Students will:
- Use JavaScript to access Google Earth Engine's API and manipulate and visualize gridded data products related to natural hazards/disasters
- Understand the history and development of the field of remote sensing, including more recent developments like critical remote sensing and existing data sources
- Be familiar with important topics in remote sensing, such as radiometry, spectral signatures, and the electromagnetic spectrum
- Be able to apply common remote sensing analytical techniques, such as image classification, calculating indices, change detection, and machine learning techniques
- Be familiar with the field of disaster studies and be able to apply remote sensing analytical techniques within this framework

### Grade Breakdown

**Class Participation (25%):**
The participation component of the course grade will be made up of in-class participation, as well as effort on in-class
exercises.

**Labs (50%):**
There will be 8 labs that will be completed throughout the course and will be graded on accuracy. These
assignments are designed to have students independently implement skills learned through course material and in-class
exercises.

**Project Tasks (10%):**
Project tasks will allow students to iteratively develop their final projects throughout the course of the semester. Each
task will allow students to complete a portion of their final project and allow the instructor to give feedback throughout
the semester.

**Final Project (10%):**
The final project will be a polished version of the completed project tasks that also implement any instructor feedback
given on individual project tasks.

**Final Presentation (5%):**
Students will give a 6–8-minute presentation on their final project during the course exam period.
