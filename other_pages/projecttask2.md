# Final Project Task 2

For this project task, you will develop a research question for your final project and appropriately "pre-process" your selected dataset

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Research Question
Your literature review and basic data exploration in Project Task 1 has given you a sense of the literature and data available about your topic and allowed you to explore open-ended questions. You also now have a clearer picture of the methodologies that you will know how to execute in this class.  

Now is the opportunity to write a clear, focused research question to guide your final project. Your research question should be:

- **Specific**. Your research question should target a specific hazard over a specified time period and geographic region.
- **Answerable** with your existing methodological skills. Be wary of words like "cause", "significance", or "prove".

**Additional Tips:**
- Consult with your instructor: Discuss your research question ideas with your instructor to ensure they are feasible and aligned with the course objectives.
- Review the literature: Read relevant research articles to see how other scholars have framed their research questions.
- Start simple: It is better to start with a narrower, more manageable question and expand it later if possible, than to start with an overly ambitious question that you cannot adequately answer.
- It is perfectly fine to refine your question as you progress through the project and gain a deeper understanding of your topic.

### Data Pre-Processing
Project Task 2 requires you to select a single dataset to analyze for your final project. You will work with a single dataset, but can work with multiple images within the dataset, depending on your spatial and temporal extent. Once you have selected your dataset, you should begin a final project script that:

- Assigns your dataset to a variable
- Executes any spatial and temporal filtering necessary to create an "analytical dataset"
- Visualizes the data in a single map
