# Final Project Task 1

For this assignment you will select your hazard of interest and identify three potential datasets from the Google Earth Engine catalog that you could use to analyze this hazard. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Selecting Hazard of Interest:
You must select a hazard that can be meaningfully analyzed using remotely sensed data, or another gridded data product available in the Google Earth Engine Data Catalog. However, you may choose to focus on a discrete event, a single day, a change analysis,a summary of a hazard, or tracking environmental recovery from a hazard. 

### Selecting Potential Datasets:
You must select at least three potential datasets from the Google Earth Engine Data Catalog. These datasets must be at a correct temporal scale (for instance, you can't do an daily analysis on monthly data), cover the correct geographical area, and contain a variable that can be effectively analyzed to provide some information about the hazard of interest.

### Introductory Research on Hazard:
You will create an annotated bibliography of at least 10 peer-reviewed academic articles. These articles can relate to the hazard, to the dataset, or to remote sensing methodologies. Your annotated bibliography should follow the guidelines from the [UNC Writing Center](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/annotated-bibliographies/)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Your final project task 1 should include:
- A paragraph that clearly lays out the hazard you have selected, including the temporal and spatial scale
- A brief paragraph for each of the three potential datasets that describes the dataset and provides a justification for why this dataset would be a good fit for your final project
- Your annotated bibliography
