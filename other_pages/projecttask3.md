# Final Project Task 3

For this project task, you will execute some of the intial EDSA tasks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Read in Data

Read in the data you created in Project Task 2. You will lose points if you 
recreate the data


### Descriptive Statistics 

Create a Descriptive Statistics table with number of observations, number of No Data (NA) observations, 
minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation for your variable of interest. You should use the [kable](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html) 
package to make the table. Provide a 2-4 sentence paragraph that includes an explanation of your data.

### Plot

Create a histogram, boxplot, or density plot using ggplot and provide a 2-4 sentence paragraph that 
includes an explanation of your data (e.g., what data are being graphed) and an interpretation of what 
you see (anything interesting or surprising?).

### Map a Variable

Create (or recreate) a choropleth map (or categorical or point map) using tmap. Provide a 4-6 sentence paragraph that explains
the geographic variation, whether this matches your expectations, and a hypothesis of why the geographic variation occurs (hint: this could be 
your research question).
