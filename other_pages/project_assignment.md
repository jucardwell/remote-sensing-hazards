### Introduction

For your final project, you will create and publish a Google Earth Engine App that applies at least one remote sensing method that we've learned in this class to a dataset (related to natural hazards) of your group's choice. The methodologies that you could implement in this project include:

- reducing/aggregating to regions
- utilizing band math or calculating an index
- creating and analyzing a time series
- change detection
- A method of your choice (in collaboration with the instructor)



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Your script should: 
-   Select a dataset from the Earth Engine Data Catalog
-   Apply at least one type of filter to the dataset (spatial, temporal)
-   Execute at least one analytical technique on the filtered data
-   Create at least one meaningful output (chart, map, table, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Your application should: 
-   Be correctly published as a Google Earth Engine App
-   Allow users to meaningfully engage with your data and analysis
-   Include at least one option for user selection/ input (button, slider, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Your final project report should: 
-   Introduce your dataset and why it is helpful for analyzing your selected hazard
-   Discuss your selected hazard, focusing on the human and environmental impacts
-   Summarize the role of remote sensing in studying the hazard you've selected 
-   Discuss the benefits of using Google Earth Engine for your analytical strategy
-   Analyze your script-created output
-   Conclude by offering suggestions for future research

Your final project report should be approximately 750-1000 words and must include at least 4 peer-reviewed references cited in APA format.

### CrediT Author Statement
A successful group project requires meaningful participation from all group members. This does not mean that each group member must contribute equally to all project tasks. Collaboration allows people to focus their efforts on parts of the project that they feel they have the most expertise and/or interest in. 

However, it is essential that groups track the contributions of group members and ensure that group members are expending equal(ish) effort towards the completion of the project. 

[CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)](https://www.elsevier.com/researcher/author/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement) was developed for academic manuscripts to accurately track individual contributions to collaborative projects. For your final project, you will craft a CrediT statement that describes the contributions of each group member. Note that not every role will be filled for this project (for instance, funding acquisition). 

Alongside the CrediT statement, each group member will complete a self-evaluation of contribution to the project.
