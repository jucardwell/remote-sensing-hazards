## Lab 6

In this lab, you will create a simple Google Earth Engine App for one of your completed lab scripts based on the skills learned in Ex. 14. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Your app should:
1. Modify existing lab script to create a published Google Earth Engine App
2. Include at least one opportunity for user selection, for instance, a button, slider, or panel, that allows a user to meaningfully interact with the data. 
 

You will submit your app.
